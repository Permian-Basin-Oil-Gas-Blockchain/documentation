=== Validator Node

==== How do I change my Node's IP address?

It would be best to avoid having to change your node's IP address. It's recommended to use a permanent IP that can dynamically point to a node's machine IP (for example, elastic IP) so you can update machines if needed without having to change the IP recorded in SKALE Manager during node registration.

If you must change your node IP in SKALE Manager, you must perform a node exit that could be costly to the node operator if it's currently supporting SKALE Chains.

To perform a node exit, follow these general steps:

1. Execute `skale exit start`.
2. Verify the exit process by executing `skale exit status`. (You don't need to wait for exit to finalize)
3. Register a new node with the new IP.

To perform a node exit but keep the node instance and its data, follow these steps:

1. Perform the general node exit procedure steps 1 and 2 above.
2. Go to `~/.skale/node_data/node_config.json` and delete all key-value **except `sgx_key_name`**.
3. Link the node to the validator ID again.
4. Register node with a new IP.
5. Execute `skale node update .env`.

==== How should validators configure back up and restore?

Validators are responsible for backing up everything on the node. SKALE Network is relying on validators to complete the backup procedure for each of the nodes. SKALE Network will be replicating the data for each SKALE Chain across 16 nodes, adding an additional layer of data availability. If a node goes down for a long time the other 2/3 of 15 will be responsible for taking the SKALE Chain's snapshot and shuffling the SKALE Chain in the SKALE Network. If a validator node is down for a long time, it may be reallocated to service new SKALE Chains depending on the length of the downtime.  

Please check https://github.com/skalenetwork/skale-node-cli/blob/develop/README.md#node-commands[node back up] and https://github.com/skalenetwork/sgxwallet/blob/develop/docs/backup-procedure.md[sgx_backup] to learn more about how to back up node or SGXWallet, and restore.

==== Where are the network communications between containers, shared configuration files and volumes stored?

You can find these details in GitHub [skale-node](https://github.com/skalenetwork/skale-node) repository and [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/skalenetwork/skale-node/blob/f928b95e69c548f12b4b21bd11a16fe2d239b83b/docker-compose.yml)  

==== How do I access the SKALE Chain's IP and ports?

Please perform the following in your terminal and pick one of the names shows up under "schains" folder:  

```shell
cd /skale_node_data/schains/
cd [chainname]
vi [chainname].json

```

=== What are the following Node ports used for?

[%header,cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Port
|Description
|Notes

|3009/TCP
|Watchdog service provides sla-agent and SKALE Monitoring/Metrics site with data about all containers statuses on all SKALE nodes
|Used by nginx as reverse proxy for Flask based Watchdog

|8080/TCP
|Used by cAdvisor (Prometheus exporter) - to analyze and expose resource usage and performance data from running docker containers
|Running cAdvisor container is optional (MONITORING_CONTAINERS=True)

|9100/TCP
|Used by Prometheus Node Exporter  - to  measure host resources such as memory, disk and CPU utilization etc.
|Running Node exporter container is optional (MONITORING_CONTAINERS=True)

|22
|Used by the node operator to ssh into the machine
|

|10000–11500/TCP
|These ports should be open for communications inside sChains between different nodes.
|When there are no sChains these ports are closed by iptables rules. It’s important to not add another firewall, because sChain configuration is created dynamically as well as iptables rules.

==== Can we use Kubernetes?

Yes. However, you will need to make sure that your platform is compatible with SKALE. In particular, your platform must allow docker-lvmpy to dynamically partition the external drive for each SKALE chain.

==== Where can I find the SKALE Node logs

Validators can run these commands to check their logs in their node:

Here are some logs and commands you can use for troubleshooting or provide logs to the core team

the most used and first place to look at

```shell
docker logs skale_api 
```

or

```shell
docker logs skale_admin 
```

transaction manager logs

```shell
docker logs skale_transaction_manager
```

all logs

```shell
skale logs dump [PATH]
```

Sgx certification in validator node:

```shell
ls -l ~/.skale/node_data/sgx_certs/
```

sgxwallet logs:

```shell
docker logs runsgx_sgxwallet_1
```

node-cli debugging logs

```shell
~/.skale/.skale-cli-log/debug-node-cli.log
```
