### Block Explorer

SKALE Network supports hundreds of SKALE Chains. Each SKALE Chain is unique and has its own set of endpoints used for sending and processing transactions. Therefore there is no "global" block height or block explorer for the SKALE Network. SKALE Network is anchored on the Ethereum Mainnet, so if you are looking for information on the SKALE Network state, please see the SKALE Manager contracts on Ethereum Mainnet.

Because of the SKALE Network design, only a dynamic block explorer that reads your SKALE Chain's endpoint will work. To see the transactions sent to your SKALE Chain, you can use the following Block Explorer.
