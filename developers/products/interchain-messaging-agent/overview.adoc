=== Interchain Messaging Agent

SKALE makes it possible to manage tokens for end-users between Ethereum and your SKALE Chain. You can use the Interchain Messaging Agent (IMA) to transfer ETH, ERC20, ERC721, or Dai to a deposit box on Ethereum, and SKALE will create clones of the token on your SKALE Chain. You can then send the tokens back to your end-users, and the tokens will be released from the deposit box back to the end-user. 

*IMA is very flexible* - it can not only support transfer tokens, but it can also transfer any arbitrary message between chains. See Managing Message Transfer below for more information.

*IMA is secure* - it uses your SKALE Chain's 16 randomly chosen validator-nodes to sign and verify messages between Mainnet and SKALE Chains using BLS threshold signatures and Trusted-Execution Environments (TEE). If that's not enough, know that each of the 16 nodes your SKALE Chain runs on has 20 million SKL tokens staked.
