### Managing ERC20

As a SKALE Chain Owner, there are two main steps to managing ERC20 through IMA:

1.  [One-time setup and map your ERC20 tokens to your SKALE Chain](/developers/products/interchain-messaging-agent/setting-up-erc20)
2.  [Transferring ERC20 using IMA](/developers/products/interchain-messaging-agent/transferring-erc20)

Once you have completed step 1 to setup and map your ERC20 tokens, you can then setup transfer flow to allow end-users to transfer ERC20 tokens between Ethereum and your SKALE Chain.
