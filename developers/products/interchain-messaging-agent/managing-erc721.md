### Managing ERC721

As a SKALE Chain Owner, there are two main steps to managing ERC721 through IMA:

1.  [One-time setup and map your ERC721 tokens to your SKALE Chain](/developers/products/interchain-messaging-agent/setting-up-erc721)
2.  [Transferring ERC721 using IMA](/developers/products/interchain-messaging-agent/transferring-erc721)

Once you have completed step 1 to setup and map your ERC721 tokens, you can then setup transfer flow to allow end-users to transfer ERC721 tokens between Ethereum and your SKALE Chain.
